# SMS-spam_classification
It is a system used to detect whether the message is a spam or not. The user has to enter the message and the system will predict whether it is a spam or not.
Streamlit was used to run the website and Jupyter notebook was used to train and save the model.
Naive Bayes algorithm was used to implement this system. Along with it some other algorithms like random forest were also used to check the accuracy and precision of several algorithms.
Based on the comparison between the algoritms, Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm had better precision and accuracy so it was used as the model to predict the spam messages.
